Javascript Assignment 2, Trivia Game


Triva game built with HTML, CSS, JS & JQuery

Triva from: "https://opentdb.com/"

Click new game button to start a game

game consists of 5 rounds

answer within the time limit (10 seconds) or the game will skip the question when time runs out

after either a correct or incorrect answer is clicked, or if time runs out, a new question will be displayed, up to round 5.

currently the triva is all science and nature themed, and the difficulty can be either easy, medium or hard

in the future I would like to add drop down / toggle buttons to allow the user to select catagory and difficulty 

Thanks for reading my readMe :)
